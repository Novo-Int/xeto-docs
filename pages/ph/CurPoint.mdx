# CurPoint
Point with support to report a &quot;real-time&quot; current value.  By real-time
we typically mean freshness within the order of a few seconds or at
most a few minutes.  For systems with direct I/O the current value is
typically driven by the I/O scan rate. For overlay systems which acquire
data via a protocol such as BACnet or Modbus then the current value
is typically refreshed using polling or subscription over a network.

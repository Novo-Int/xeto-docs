# VrfHeatRecoverySystem
Heat recovery VRF system can operate cooling and heating by each indoor unit
independently, at the same time. Heat recovery VRF systems have branch selectors
to control how much, and which (hot gas or subcooled liquid) refrigerant
goes to each indoor unit.  See `docHaystack::VRF#types` chapter.

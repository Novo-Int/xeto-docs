# Well
A well is a source of groundwater and potentially thermal energy.  When
used within an [ATES]`docHaystack::ATES` system, the well facilitates thermal
energy exchange with the ground warm and cool water sources. In this case, a
well can be either a closed system that transports water through pipes in the
ground, or an open system that pumps up and returns ground water.

## Subtypes
### AirSystem
System for moving air to maintain indoor thermal comfort and/or air quality. 
[More...](./AirSystem)
### AirConditioningSystem
System for air treatment to control its temperature, humidity, cleanliness,
and distribution to meet the requirements of a conditioned space. 
[More...](./AirConditioningSystem)
### AirExhaustSystem
System consisting of one or more fans that remove air from the building.
Exhaust systems allow outdoor air to enter by ventilation inlets or normal
leakage paths sthrough the building envelope. 
[More...](./AirExhaustSystem)
### AirVentilationSystem
System that supplies or removes air by natural or mechanical means to or
from any space in order to provide outdoor air to the space. Such air may or
may not have been conditioned. 
[More...](./AirVentilationSystem)
### ElecSystem
System that generates, converts, distributes, and/or stores electricity. 
[More...](./ElecSystem)
### EvseSystem
A system that supplies electricity to EVSE assembly equipment and its
auxiliary loads. 
[More...](./EvseSystem)
### LightingSystem
System designed to provide lighting. 
[More...](./LightingSystem)
### RefrigSystem
Refrigerant distribution to fulfill all or parts of a refrigeration cycle. 
[More...](./RefrigSystem)
### VrfSystem
Variable refigerant flow system.  The system contains the indoor
units, outdoor units, and branch selectors.  See `docHaystack::VRF#types`
chapter. 
[More...](./VrfSystem)
### VrfCoolingOnlySystem
Cooling only VRF system can only cool; heating is not available.
See `docHaystack::VRF#types` chapter. 
[More...](./VrfCoolingOnlySystem)
### VrfHeatPumpSystem
Heat pump VRF system can either heat, or cool, but not at the same time.
See `docHaystack::VRF#types` chapter. 
[More...](./VrfHeatPumpSystem)
### VrfHeatRecoverySystem
Heat recovery VRF system can operate cooling and heating by each indoor unit
independently, at the same time. Heat recovery VRF systems have branch selectors
to control how much, and which (hot gas or subcooled liquid) refrigerant
goes to each indoor unit.  See `docHaystack::VRF#types` chapter.

### WaterSystem
System that supplies or collects potable or non-potable water in any state. 
[More...](./WaterSystem)
### ChilledWaterSystem
System that circulates water in its liquid state below ambient temperature
for cooling a space or process. 
[More...](./ChilledWaterSystem)
### CondenserWaterSystem
System that circulates water in its liquid state for rejecting heat
from a space or process. 
[More...](./CondenserWaterSystem)
### DomesticWaterSystem
System that circulates potable water in its liquid state for purposes
other than space conditioning and process requirements. 
[More...](./DomesticWaterSystem)
### DomesticColdWaterSystem
System that circulates potable cold water in its liquid state for purposes
other than space cooling and process requirements. 
[More...](./DomesticColdWaterSystem)
### DomesticHotWaterSystem
System that circulates potable hot water in its liquid state for purposes
other than space heating and process requirements. 
[More...](./DomesticHotWaterSystem)
### HotWaterSystem
System that circulates water in its liquid state for heating
a space or process. 
[More...](./HotWaterSystem)
### SteamSystem
System that circulates water in its vapor state for heating
a space or process.

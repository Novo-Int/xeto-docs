# WritablePoint
Point with writable output using 16-level priority array.  Writable
points typically are a setpoint or actuator command.  Haystack writable
points are modeled on the BACnet 16-level priority array with a
relinquish default which effectively acts as level 17.

The following levels have special behavior:
 - **Level 1**: highest priority reserved for emergency overrides
 - **Level 8**: manual override with ability to set timer to expire back to auto
 - **Default**: implicitly acts as level 17 for relinquish default

The priority array provides for contention resolution when many different
control applications may be vying for control of a given point. Low level
applications like scheduling typically control levels 14, 15, or 16. Then
users can override at level 8. But a higher levels like 2 to 7 can be used
to trump a user override (for example a demand response energy routine
that requires higher priority).

The actual value to write is resolved by starting at level 1 and working down
to relinquish default to find the first non-null value. It is possible for
all levels to be null, in which case the overall write output is null (which
in turn may be auto/null to another system). Anytime a null value is written
to a priority level, we say that level has been set to auto or released (this
allows the next highest level to take command of the output).

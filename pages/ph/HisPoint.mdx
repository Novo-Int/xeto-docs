# HisPoint
Historized point with a history log of timestamp/value pairs.  Points
marked as historized indicate the system can response to queries via
the &#39;hisRead&#39; operation to return a trend log of timestamp/value pairs.

There are typically two mechanisms for historization:
  - the local system performs the historization by logging the
    point&#39;s `curVal` to local storage
  - in overlay systems a downstream device performs the historization
    and the local system synchronizes the history data in batch on
    a periodic basis

### Entity
Top-level dicts with a unique identifier.

## Subtypes
### CurPoint
Point with support to report a &quot;real-time&quot; current value.  By real-time
we typically mean freshness within the order of a few seconds or at
most a few minutes.  For systems with direct I/O the current value is
typically driven by the I/O scan rate. For overlay systems which acquire
data via a protocol such as BACnet or Modbus then the current value
is typically refreshed using polling or subscription over a network.
Also see `docHaystack::Points#cur` chapter.[More...](./CurPoint)
### HisPoint
Historized point with a history log of timestamp/value pairs.  Points
marked as historized indicate the system can response to queries via
the &#39;hisRead&#39; operation to return a trend log of timestamp/value pairs.

There are typically two mechanisms for historization:
  - the local system performs the historization by logging the
    point&#39;s `curVal` to local storage
  - in overlay systems a downstream device performs the historization
    and the local system synchronizes the history data in batch on
    a periodic basis

### WeatherPoint
Weather station observation point.

### WritablePoint
Point with writable output using 16-level priority array.  Writable
points typically are a setpoint or actuator command.  Haystack writable
points are modeled on the BACnet 16-level priority array with a
relinquish default which effectively acts as level 17.

The following levels have special behavior:
 - **Level 1**: highest priority reserved for emergency overrides
 - **Level 8**: manual override with ability to set timer to expire back to auto
 - **Default**: implicitly acts as level 17 for relinquish default

The priority array provides for contention resolution when many different
control applications may be vying for control of a given point. Low level
applications like scheduling typically control levels 14, 15, or 16. Then
users can override at level 8. But a higher levels like 2 to 7 can be used
to trump a user override (for example a demand response energy routine
that requires higher priority).

The actual value to write is resolved by starting at level 1 and working down
to relinquish default to find the first non-null value. It is possible for
all levels to be null, in which case the overall write output is null (which
in turn may be auto/null to another system). Anytime a null value is written
to a priority level, we say that level has been set to auto or released (this
allows the next highest level to take command of the output).
